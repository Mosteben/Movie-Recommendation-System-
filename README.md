# Movie Recommendation System - Summary

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a Python application that manages movie information and provides recommendations to users. Key features include:

1. **Adding Movies**: Users can input new movie details, which are stored in a file (`movie.txt`).
2. **Updating Movies**: Users can modify existing movie data by specifying the MovieName and Year.
3. **Displaying Movies**: Users can view all movies in a formatted table with options to sort by various fields.
4. **Retrieving Specific Information**: Users can access data based on criteria such as top-selling movies and revenue statistics.
5. **Saving by Genre**: Users can filter movies by genre and save results to a new file.
6. **Exiting**: The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

The application ensures data integrity through validation checks, automatically generates unique MovieIDs, and handles case insensitivity for movie names. It will be tested with a sample dataset to verify functionality.
